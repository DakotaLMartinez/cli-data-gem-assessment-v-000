open up the cli-data-gem-assessment-v-000
click the open IDE button 
run your bundle gem gem_name command 
cd into the gem_name directory 
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
go to our fresh github repository and paste in the two lines below this heading: â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line 

git remote add origin git@github.com:DakotaLMartinez/gem_name.git
git push -u origin master

and now when you refresh the page on GitHub you should see your gem directory structure as it appears inside of the IDE file tree.
